### WVUP recreate
-------

This assignment is to recreate the wvup.edu homepage using what you have learned so far.  Feel free to use your new found knowledge of bootstrap or classic vanilla html/css


Things to not do:
- take screenshots and use image tags -_-
- copy css directly
- copy and rename css
- utilize other students css #smh
- Doesnt have to be 1 to 1 for evey menu item or any JS functionality (focus on just building the html)

Things that are okay:
- Inspect their structure and styles...and apply it in your own way
- Helping each other with any elements that are a little trickier

		<p>Some things I like people to know are that I was in the Parkersburg South High School marching band, 
			<BR>had a solo in the field show my senior year, was a Young Friend of Blennerhasset which meant I helped the docents with the guided tours of the 
			<BR>mansion and did period correct crafts with the kids that came to the island when not helping with the tours, and finally 
			<BR>after many years of missing out due to the Black Walnut Marching Band copetition I got the chance to volunteer at the Mansion by Candlelight tour.</p>
			
		<p>I also love dragons.</p>
